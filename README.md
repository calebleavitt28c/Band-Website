# Band-Website
I created single page app for my band. Includes responsive code, and a form with CRUD properties

The responsive code relates to varying window sizes and adjusting the layout of the page to better fit 
window size.

When a user navigates to the visitor page they can log their visit to the site. When they click on the
"log visit" button a form will appear. This form has validation code for each field in the from to ensure 
the user enters correct values and follows correct formats. All visitors logged are listed on the visitor
page. Visitors listed can be deleted. The edit button has not been implemented yet. 

The PARTY was made for fun. It activates a differnt .css file which contains an @keyframes change animation to
alternate between background-colors on different parts of the page the user is one.
